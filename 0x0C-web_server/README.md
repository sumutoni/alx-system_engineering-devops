# Web Server
Building on the ssh project, here we use scp to copy files to our server, install nginx on it and fiddle with its configuration file to create a 301 and custom 404 HTTP responses.

Other command used is curl to GET the HTTP requests from the server.
All scripts written try to automate each task.
